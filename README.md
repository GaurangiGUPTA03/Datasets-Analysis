# Datasets-Analysis

# Analysis and Machine Learning on Multiple Datasets

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves data analysis and machine learning applied to **five different datasets**. The goal is to extract insights, preprocess data, and build predictive models.

## 📂 Datasets
The analysis is performed on the following datasets:
1. **smart_grid** 
2. **RedWineQuality** 
3. **coffee_shop_revenue** 
4. **AI_resume** 
5. **Dataset 5** 

## 🔬 Machine Learning Models
The following machine learning techniques have been applied:
- Linear Regression, Decision Trees
- Model evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used.

## 🛠️ Installation & Dependencies
To run this project, install the required dependencies using:
