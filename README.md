# Datasets-Analysis

# Analysis and Machine Learning on Multiple Datasets

## üìå Project Overview
This project involves data analysis and machine learning applied to **five different datasets**. The goal is to extract insights, preprocess data, and build predictive models.

## üìÇ Datasets
The analysis is performed on the following datasets:
1. **smart_grid** 
2. **RedWineQuality** 
3. **coffee_shop_revenue** 
4. **AI_resume** 
5. **Dataset 5** 

## üî¨ Machine Learning Models
The following machine learning techniques have been applied:
- Linear Regression, Decision Trees
- Model evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used.
